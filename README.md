# Metal FS

Metal FS augments the Linux file system to expose FPGA-based near-storage accelerators.

## Getting Started

For general information and development prerequisites, please refer to the [project documentation](https://metalfs.github.io).

To get started with developing applications using Metal FS, we recommend the [getting started repository](https://github.com/metalfs/getting-started) and our [tutorial](https://metalfs.github.io/tutorial.html).
